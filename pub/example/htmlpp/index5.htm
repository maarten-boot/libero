<BR>- added DIR_HREFL field for .build dir
<BR>- corrected error in &date function (thanks to Enrique Bengoechea).
<BR>- added support for multilanguage &date function (also thanks to EB).
<BR>- added the .pipe command and PIPE_HEADER, PIPE_FOOTER blocks.
<BR>- added -nofunc option (thanks to Alister Bulman).
<BR>- added -nosplit option for the .macro command.

<LI>Version 4.0e published 31 May 1998
<BR>- added a number of date-handling intrinsic functions.
<BR>- .for loops generate a .define command for their loop variable (thanks
      to Bernard de Rubinat).
<BR>- corrected an error in the -page option.
<BR>- default value for an anchor is now the anchor title.

<LI>Version 4.0d published 9 May 1998
<BR>- $(*name) was failing for simple anchors.
<BR>- .define commands are kept through passes, which makes loops
      work much better (thanks to Bernard de Rubinat).
<BR>- added &system() intrinsic function (thanks to Keith Dart).
<BR>- no longer does case-conversion in .build dir blocks.
<BR>- removed warning on long filenames.
<BR>- added -page switch for selective page generation.

<LI>Version 4.0c published 18 April 1998
<BR>- Added DIR_SIZEK and DIR_SIZEM directory block variables
<BR>- Finally, you can escape variables in macro text so that
      they are only expanded in the next pass.
<BR>- LINEMAX now defaults to 0 (no warnings).
<BR>- Worked-around bug in Perl which caused htmlpp to block when
      macro arguments contained single quote '.
<BR>- &(expr) was not working - fixed by James Thieler.
<BR>- Symbols that refer to anchors now produce anchor title if possible,
      thanks to Craig Smith.

<LI>Version 4.0b published 24 February 1998
<BR>- Correctly handles comments in macro definitions
<BR>- Allows .page commands to be built by .for loops
<BR>- Underlines in macro arguments are no longer replaced by spaces.
<BR>- Lines ending in '\' are output without trailing newlines

<LI>Version 4.0a published 07 February 1998
<BR>- Searches LIBPATH, then PATH for document files.
<BR>- Macros can now contain { escape sequences (e.g. for JavaScript
      subroutines)
<BR>- Multiline .echo commands now work.
<BR>- Added various new intrinsic functions.
<BR>- Intrinsic &time() did not work - fixed.
<BR>- Symbol expansion code rewritten to allow any level of embedding.

<LI>Version 3.0 published 16 June 1997.
<BR>V3.9e - .for command changed to handle variable expansion in a
smarter manner: for loop variables are expanded, but others are copied
through to next pass.
<BR>V3.9d - .block commands are no longer interpreted in the first
pass; this lets you change headers and footers within a document.
$(*symbol) was wrongly translated sometimes.
<BR>V3.9c - added &image_width() and &image_height() intrinsic
functions; added $(TOC_LEVEL) variable.
<BR>V3.9b - reversed changes of version 3.8; macros expand variables
immediately.  This was needed to correctly generate tables of contents.
Also changed %(VAR) behaviour to match documentation - if variable is
not defined, no error message is issued.
<BR>V3.9a - added anchor titles, $0, and $#.
<BR>V3.9 - added header level numbering and $+ symbol; added -env
option.
<BR>V3.8 - variables in macro text are translated in following pass.
<BR>V3.7 - correctly uses htm variable for output files.
<BR>V3.6 - added guru_opt.fmt file for finer GuruMode control.
<BR>V3.5 - improved GuruMode, again again.
<BR>V3.4 - improved GuruMode, again.
<BR>V3.3 - added $(DOCBASE) variable; improved multiline macros,
improved GuruMode.
<BR>V3.2 - no longer complains on forward anchors references.
Removed .guru command and reworked GuruMode.
<BR>V3.1 - updated some functions and improved the doc.
<BR>V3.00 - Added macro capabilities; added GuruMode; fixed some
incompatibilities with Perl 4; added .for autosplit feature; \.
replaced by . in whole line, not just at start; added support for
accented characters.

<LI>Version 2.2 published 25 May 1997.
<BR>V2.21 - added intrinsic function syntax, and &date().

<BR>V2.14 - ".define xx = expr" now expands variables first.
<BR>V2.13 - .build dir always lists filenames in lowercase.
<BR>V2.11 - variable expansion improved a little.
<BR>V2.12 - cosmetic changes.
<BR>V2.10 - .define command is resolved as late as possible,
instead of immediately.  .For loops may be indented; $for_list
is accessible locally inside each level.  Minor documentation
cleanups.  Fixed error in .if block parsing.  Lots of cosmetic
changes to eliminate warnings when 'perl -w' used.  Corrected
misnumbering of HTML headers.

<BR>V2.01 - added &(...) symbol; added .include `command`;
blocks can now contain action lines; added index_open,
index_close, and index_entry blocks; rewrote dialog to do
multipass processing.  Whew.  Oh yeah: added .for/.endfor as
asked for by Dave Rockwell (rockwell@wwwcis4.shr.dec.com).
