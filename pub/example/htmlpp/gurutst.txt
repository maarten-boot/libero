Subheader 2.1 : Tables and links.
---------------------------------

Column: Explanation:
Table_item_with_some_spaces: Here is what is all means
    We should be able to span this one over
    more lines than just one.
Another_table_item: More things follow in this table.

 Oh yeah: The links. Note how this line ends in a colon:
 but when we indent it, it is not treated as a table header.

You can mail to
  <me@xxxxx.net>
or
  <myself@another.xxxx.com>
or look at the homepage
  <http://www.xxxx.com/myself>

DON'T USE :    <me@nothere.com> or <xx@yy.zz>

  You can use colons if you indent the line. Below two links alone!
  <me@xxxx.net> <http://www.xxx.zz>

Subheader 2.2 : The figures.
----------------------------
Here is a figure
[Figure filename.gif: explanation of that graphic file]

And another figure
["filename.gif" : another image file]

This has no explanation:
[filename2.gif]

But here we add a colon AND A SPACE:
[filname3.gif : explanation for number 3]

You NEED THE TEXT FOR ALT!
