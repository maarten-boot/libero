    in bad taste, and probably offensive to many people.  If you choose to

 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

    Bill Gates again demonstrated the flexibility that would make a circus
    contortionist envious, and that makes Microsoft act more like a two-man
    start-up than the behemoth it really is.  With a modest $150M of small
    change thrown into Apple's hat, Microsoft has ensured that its software
    (and especially its browser) will be embedded in future Mac systems.

    Apple's stock rose from a low point of $12.5 to $26.5 in less than a
    month.  If Bill is willing to invest in Apple, so are we, I guess.

    Of course, the really interesting question is "Why?"  I've been asking
    around, and have collected lots of theories.  These mostly fall into
    these camps:

    1.  Bill is really scared of Apple's future Rhapsody system, so wants
        to be sure that Windows NT won't be made obsolete by it.

    2.  Bill just wants to make sure that Rhapsody is actually NT 5.  Why
        make life hard for the consumer with all those tough choices.

    3.  Bill and Steve are really scared by Java, so want to make a last-
        ditch stand against the Sun/Netscape/Oracle camp.

    4.  Bill and Steve are really scared by the Network Computer (which is
        a variation of the Java Threat, only it also includes Nintendo in
        the enemy camp.)

    5.  Bill is worried about the Trust Busters who think he has an unfair
        grip on the computer software industry.  He reckons that by buying
        part of Apple, he can say that he's not only interested in profits,
        but has a heart too.

    5.  Bill and Steve are both Scientologists and this is part of a plot
        to censor all anti-Scientology newsgroups.

    6.  Bill and Steve are both scared by *something*, and it's not Sun,
        nor Netscape, nor Oracle.  (Nor iMatix, though they *should* be.)
        They've realised that the old Evil Empire, IBM, is still around,
        leaner, meaner, and getting ready to blast the parvenues into
        bloody smithereens.

    Well, at iMatix HQ we came to a more mundane conclusion. $150M is only
    three times what Bill spends each year on developing Internet Explorer,
    something he then gives away for nothing.  For this he gets control of
    the Mac desktop, snubs Netscape, and creates a little more market share
    for his milk cow, Office.

    Oh yes, his $150M purchase in shares is now worth over $300M, so it was
    not exactly wasted money.

    Yes, another short newsletter this month.  The whole iMatix crew have
    just come back from vacation, and don't feel like working.  Lazy lot!
    So, while we get-out the cattle prods and cat-o-nines, we shamefully
    present our humblest excuses for a truncated edition.  However, we must
    make it clear that we still aspire to becoming a Serious Journal, with
    articles on subjects like 'The Somatropic Effects Of Mixed Bilateral
    Conjunctions' and 'Building Your Own Multithreaded Coffee Dispenser'.

    In the meantime you'll have to be content with the usual junk.

    Oh yes, all the usual terms and conditions apply.  Any text that may
    appear to have humouristic tendencies is provided without guarantee of
    any kind, including the assumed promise of SUITABILITY FOR CHILDREN,
    and in no conditions will iMatix be responsible, liable, or forfeit for
    the consequences of CULTURAL HUMOURISTIC SHIFTING or simple BAD JOKES.
    Everything in CAPITALS should be read while standing upside-down.

    Xitami 2.0 goes into Beta Test!
        Yes, the web server that dares to say 'Boo!' to the big guys is
        getting ready for round II.  What's new?  FTP, browser-based admin,
        lots of improvements and bug fixes, more portability.  Xitami 2.0
        also runs on Digital OpenVMS.  With version 2.0 you'll be able to
        run and manage the same web server on dozens of different systems.

    iMatix Denies Involvement!
        Amid rumours and press reports, a frazzled iMatix spokesman denied
        today that iMatix was involved in any way whatsoever in the tragic
        and premature death of Lady Di, a fourteen-year old cocker spaniel
        that demonstrated once more the effects of kinetic energy when it
        ran happily into the road and under a number twelve bus.

    Yesterday morning the iMatix Internal Quality Manager was strolling
    through the office when he came across Mandy, sorting-out the e-mail in
    large heaps across her desk.  (She told us this tale in hushed tones
    over espresso this morning.)  He berated her for keeping so much useless
    paper on her desk (his words, not ours) and told her to throw-out
    everything that was not absolutely vital.  As she explained, she did
    this, filling fifteen large recycling boxes with old emails saying
    'Xitami is the greatest', 'I don't understand Libero', 'how do I build
    SFL on SunOS', and so on.  Big Al asked Mandy if her desk was now
    cleared.  'Of course not,' she replied.  'I never throw anything away
    without making a photocopy first!'

    Here are a couple of the letters that survived.

    Thanks Art.  Perhaps we can use your recommendations to get Mandy to
    upgrade from her Commodore-64 with Easy-Write.

    Nils is referring to the soon-to-be-released version 2.0 of Xitami, also
    known as 'Xitami 97', where '97' is the percentage of people who cannot
    pronounce the name.


 == THE EX FILES --...-.-.--.-..-:\---..-.-.-.--...-.-.---.-.---...-.-....-.-

    In keeping with this month's theme, we bring you the totally irrelevant
    and probably treasonable "Di Theory Of The Month" page.  Our paparazzi
    have been busy...

    Theory 1: Di and company died in a car crash, chased by photographers.
        This theory is laughable, and we rejected it immediately.  It's
        just too bizarre.  We told this to Occam and he fell-over laughing,
        "Come on", he said, "An amour plated Mercedes 600 does not stop
        for anything, let alone some concrete pillars. Why did they chose
        a drunken driver, instead of their helicopter. Why flee the press
        photographers that they'd been courting all evening at the Ritz?
        Why did Al Fayeed (little Al?) only have one bodyguard with him.
        Look at it like any crime: who stands to benefit the most?"

    Theory 2: Di and co. were killed by a hit squad sent by The Firm*.
        (Oh oh, they'll send the SAS to iMatix HQ for this!)  This is more
        like it.  Very convenient, Princess Di's departure.  Now Charlie
        can marry again, be King, and Di won't go off with that foreign
        chap.  Besides, she tried to leave The Firm, and there really is
        only one exit.  And we know that most premature terminations are
        caused by unwanted interactions with one's kith and kin.

    Theory 3: Di and co. did not die at all, but were abducted by aliens.
        We like this one, but it implies that the French were involved in
        a cover-up, and we know the French.  They could not organise such
        a delicate matter.  (Desole, mes amis, mais il faut pouvoir faire
        un blague ou deux de temps en temps.)

    Theory 4: Di had arranged with The Firm to fake her death, which would
        benefit everyone: Di gets the hundred mill, Charlie can marry again,
        and the land mine conference gets its saint.  Only problem: The Firm
        has its own ideas, and switches to plan B as described by Theory 2.

    Theory 5: Di is alive and living with Elvis.

    Theory 6: Di really is Michael Jackson!  Why else would he have to cancel
        his concert.  Being dead is a real hinderance.  Though it does not
        seem to stop the Rolling Stones from doing another World Tour.

    Remember - you read it here first!
