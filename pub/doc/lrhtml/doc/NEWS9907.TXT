 == COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--
    
    The other day, I switched on my PC, ready and inspired to write another
    great editorial for Liberetto.  Yes, with a few strokes of the keyboard,
    Xitamibert creates a masterpiece of wit and insight, ready to be beamed
    electronically across our wired globe. 

    It takes an awfully long time to boot a PC.  Didn't I read somewhere
    that Microsoft were going to start putting adverts on the boot screen?
    Anyway, my PC ground and chugged, but the screen just stayed blank.
    In the Hacker's Dictionary, this moment, identified by the feeling of
    one's insides turning rapidly into greasy chopped liver, is called the
    "Ohno second".  Oh-no, here we go...

    I'm not going to go into detail, but the upshot was that the video card
    was broken.  Easily enough replaced with something new, but Windows NT
    would not start any longer.  I guessed it was trying to load the drivers
    for the old card.  Anyhow, impossible to make it start.

    Resolving this kind of problem with Windows is like trying to drive
    through a busy city with a map dating from 1920, a car that won't turn
    left, and three drunken co-pilots.  You can get there eventually, but it
    hurts.

    So, this is one more entry for the Windows NT FAQ.  Question: what do I
    do when I change video cards, and Windows NT won't boot?  Answer: install
    a new copy of NT, in a separate directory, so you keep the old NT.
    Boot-up in the new NT, and then find your old video card drivers. Delete
    these.  Don't make any mistakes, and make sure you delete everything.
    Now reboot into the old NT.  With luck it will start-up.  Now install the
    software drivers for your new video card.  Edit the hidden system file
    'c:\boot.ini' and delete the new NT entries.  Also delete the new NT
    directory.  Total time: 55 minutes.  Possible fatal mistakes: 10.

    The alternative is to re-install from scratch, reinstall all your
    applications, shortcuts, security, disk configurations, and get
    counselling.  Total time: 6 hours.  Possible fatal mistakes: 3.

    I've worked with computers half my life, and I'm reduced to the choice of
    doing brain surgery on my PC, or wasting a day doing it the normal way.  

    My conclusion is that I've done a Faustian bargain with Bill Gates: I
    get GUI word processing and e-mail, and he gets my soul and life-blood.
    I don't think it's a good bargain.  Now, where were those Linux CD's?

    Subject:        	your VB schema for Libero
    Date sent:      	Wed, 26 May 1999 08:20:24 PDT
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I would like to use Libero to generate visual basic code to implement a
    simple communication protocol state machine using the MSComm control.
    I don't understand how to use the code generated using your vb schema.
    Can you point me to some examples. I am using VB 6.0.  What I am confused 
    about is:
    - what is the entry point? which function should i call from Main() or
    some VB click_event handler.
    - how do i deal with events on the MSComm control i am using i.e how to
    use raise_exception?
    Any help would be appreciated.
    Thank you.
    - srini

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Pieter Hintjens replies:
    The code generated is basically for a subroutine, whose name is
    initially the same as that of the source file, but you can change
    that easily in the .bas file which is produced.  The code is for
    VB3, so you may need to modify the schema - I've not worked with
    VB since version 3.

    Dealing with the events is a little delicate.  You need to define an
    event-handler for MSComm events, and pass these event to your state
    machine in a useful way.  One way is to use an event queue.  This is a
    queue which one party (the event handler) stuffs with incoming events,
    and the other party (your Libero program) processes event by event.
    You can map external MSComm events to internal Libero events in any
    way you need to.  I'd not use exception events for this - use them
    only as a way of controlling the dialog in case of errors.

    Subject:        	Why use Xitami?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    After looking over http://www.xitami.com/ I'm left wondering, whyuse 
    Xitami rather than say Apache?
    Your site would benefit from having more of a "sales pitch" for 
    Xitami, or at least a competitive analysis or something that attempts 
    to position it in comparison to the competition.
    On a side note, I'd also like to see a "history of Xitami" section
    that would offer an introduction to the lead developers, why they 
    chose to create Xitami (rather than work on existing open source 
    products), and what code has Xitami inherited.

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    'Competition'?  I don't think we have any...  Well, maybe a little here
    and there.  It's interesting to see how Xitami has developed, both as a
    product and a community.  First off, we built it as a technology
    demonstrator.  Xitami is the iMatix web server, based on our tools and
    methods.  We reused about 200 lines of code from Apache, namely to
    handle image maps.  Everything else is original.

    We never did much advertising for Xitami.  People use it because they've
    heard about it from friends and colleagues, and we estimate that over
    100,000 people use it worldwide.  This is the kind of thing you see in
    the newsgroups:

        Could anybody tell the minimum Settings for the Apache WebServer to:
        - test CGI-Programs
        - to have a local domain
        - and letting every user make use of it (everybody can have all the
        permissions)
        
        (I don't have the time and not the need of a professional Apache
        Server, I've got that O'Reilly Book, but I think it is difficult to
        understand, ... I just want to test CGI Programs)
        >
        Why then not run a smaller, and not so difficult server like Xitami.
        Check out the iMatix hompage at www.imatix.com. Is all for free (open
        source), and very easy to setup.  Works on both Windows, OS/2, Unix
        and OpenVMS.

    Search www.deja.com and you'll see lots of this kind of thing. People
    *like* Xitami, although I can't see why.  Just because it's small, fast,
    easy to install, and hardly ever crashes.  I thought all software was
    made like that.

    A big "thank you" for this latest installment.  It got several of us

    Please accept my thanks for your offerings.  Today I visited your site
    and updated my copy of Xitami, which a friend had left behind on my
    machine, and, being curious, also a copy of Libero.  Having read the
    documentation I confess I am still lost, but the little I can see of
    the scheme appears quite elegant.  Feel free to let me know from time
    to time what is happening in the iMatix world.

    Libero is kind of unreal, sometimes.  The only way we know to appreciate
    it is to use it... the 'Aha!' light-bulb clicks-on after a week or so,
    and it all makes sense.  Thanks for your interest in our work.

    So... something like 16,000 distinct visitors per month, from 100
    countries.  The website hums 24 hours a day, and the average visitor
    reads 5 webpages before downloading Xitami or another package. Since we
    use mirror sites, we don't have statistics for the number of downloads.

    Interesting facts:
    
     - Over 50% of visitors use Microsoft MSIE.
     - We had visitors from all of the countries of ex-Yugoslavia.
     - The top 5 countries visiting iMatix.com are: US, Germany, Canada,
       UK, and Brazil  
     - Germans make-up about 8% of our visitors, a steady statistic.
     - iMatix.com gets 40 times more visitors than it did in February 1996,
       exactly 40 months ago.

    In Liberetto IV/6 we wrongly dated the editorial '1 May 1999'. We
    apologise to all members of trades unions, communist parties and marxist
    guerillas who may have been offended by this.
