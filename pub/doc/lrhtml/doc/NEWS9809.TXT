    Here in Belgium, the end of Summer coincides with the start of the school
    year, with the return of free and unlimited parking on the autoroutes,
    and with general relief in the population as people can stop complaining
    about the lousy Summer weather and start complaining about the lousy
    Autumn weather.

    Nothing much happened in August, generally, apart from the fall of the
    Russian presidency, the onset of the world economic crisis, and signs
    that terrorists are starting to get nasty again, after two decades of
    only minor fireworks.

    This month we're able to bring you the fruit of our Xitami User's
    Survey, something that would have been impossible before the days of
    e-mail.  Now it was simply a matter of sending out a small
    questionnaire, then standing back as hundreds of replies flooded our
    mail system.  Thanks to all of you who answered.

    As well as the many people who replied to the survey, we got a full and
    varied mailbag.  It's one of the pleasures of my job to go through some
    of these mails, which range from the profoundly interesting to the
    frankly bizarre.

    Thanks for all the mails, and keep on enjoying the software!

 == XITAMI USERS SURVEY .-..-..-...----.-.-...---.---...--.----.-..---.-.--..

    We sent out about 1400 questionnaires and got 370 responses.  To show
    you the results we've collated the figures back into the original
    questions:

    1  How many months have you been using Xitami?
    1a   [ 41] Less than 1 month
    1b   [ 57] 1 to 3 months
    1c   [ 75] 3 to 6 months
    1d   [112] 6 to 12 months
    1e   [ 81] more than a year

    2  Used for (please insert an X where appropriate):
    2a   [106] Intranet, for [] users
    2b   [ 84] Intranet web applications
    2c   [214] Testing
    2d   [205] Internet
    2e   [  9] CD-Rom web application

    3  Platforms:
    3a   [134] Windows NT
    3b   [289] Windows 95
    3c   [ 32] Linux
    3d   [ 38] OS/2
    3e   [  5] Other Unix

    4  Satisfaction:
    4a   Stability           [247] Excellent [ 98] Good [12] Average [ 5] Poor
    4b   Performance         [244] Excellent [105] Good [ 9] Average [ 0] Poor
    4c   Documentation       [ 94] Excellent [175] Good [73] Average [17] Poor
    4d   Support             [157] Excellent [137] Good [33] Average [ 6] Poor
    4e   Ease-of-use         [207] Excellent [121] Good [24] Average [ 4] Poor
    4f   Functionality       [155] Excellent [163] Good [38] Average [ 1] Poor
    4g   Rate of improvement [130] Excellent [169] Good [41] Average [ 2] Poor
    4h   imatix.com website  [ 77] Excellent [204] Good [59] Average [ 5] Poor

    Of the 1400 people polled, 66 run an Internet website (we'll be adding a
    page to imatix.com with these links).  We know that there are about 500
    Internet sites that use Xitami, so a quick application of data-sleuthing
    techniques lets us estimate that there are about 10,000 Xitami users out
    there.  We're assuming that anyone who is serious enough to use Xitami
    for an Internet web site would respond to the survey, and be glad to be
    listed on our site.

    The results of the survey are interesting.  Clearly many people have a
    hard time with the documentation.  We also received a large number of
    excellent ideas for changes and improvements.

    The person (who will remain nameless, Bill) who asked that Xitami be
    supplied with an espresso, English-style toast (one side only) and a
    French maid should be ashamed.  Everyone knows that Belgian waffles
    are far superior to English toast.

    We promised a free copy of Xitami/Pro (Xitami's big brother, which
    supports the Secure Sockets Layer) to one respondent chosen at random.
    So, we cut-out the little 'From:' lines in each mail, put the whole lot
    into a hat, and asked the concierge, Harry, to pull one out.  Okay, in
    truth we wrote a small Perl script as a snip-n-hat Harry simulator, but
    the results were just as impressive.  The proud (we hope) winner of a
    Xitami/Pro is Dan Nitescu <dan.nitescu@swipnet.se>.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hello,
    I recently discovered your SMT kernel and after reading a bit about it
    have gotten the idea that it would make a great part of a software agent
    development environment I'm working on. I'm implementing my system in
    Python, and thought about trying to use Swig to generate a python
    wrapper for SMT.
    I was hoping that someone there might be wiling to pass along some
    thoughts on this idea. This would be my first use of Swig, and I have
    cetain reservations about how closely SMT is tied to Libero.

    Firstly please add me to your Liberetto mailing list - I was on it a
    couple of years ago (at a different email address), but for some reason
    I stopped receiving it after a few months.
    I have just downloaded and started playing with Xitami - great stuff.  I
    am glad to see you have included examples in Python. It is my current
    language of choice and deserves far wider coverage.
    Talking of Python has anyone done a Libero schema for the language yet?
    I may attempt one myself if no one else has, though I can see there
    could be problems with Python's method of using indentation to delimit
    blocks, though I haven't looked at schemas closely enough to tell how
    limiting this would be.

    Subject:            Libero
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hi!
    I have just managed to persuade our computer department to download your
    product Libero. (They haven't managed to install it correctly yet, but
    that's another question). I heard about Libero a week or two ago when
    someone in comp.lang.ada asked for a tool for creating state machines.
    Someone suggested Libero, but also stated that it didn't yet support Ada.
    He also made a hint that you might produce Ada support if someone asked
    for it...  Well, here I am, asking for it!
    As a mostly military company we make much of our software in Ada and
    freqently use state machines. Now it's mostly up to the hacker himself
    how the state machine is implemented and I think that a tool for
    generating them would be useful to us.
    I haven't had time to look that much into what Libero produces (mostly
    since they haven't installed it correctly yet, but I downloaded the
    win-version at home and had a quick look). One thing that I didn't find
    was a graphical view of the complete state machine (not just current
    state and next) with all the states and transitions. That's something
    to consider for future versions.
    Please let me know if you have the intention to make Ada support for
    Libero.  And I would also like to have Ada 83 compatibility since we
    still use that in some projects.

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Thanks for your mail about Libero. From what you say about frequently
    using state machines, Libero would be a useful tool for your work.
    Certainly it provides a single syntax for state machines that is
    language-independent and can easily be shared between developers and
    teams. You will find that it makes FSM programs much more maintainable
    than previously, and provides a high-level design that can be provided
    as part of the formal program specifications.

    It's true that the Windows GUI does not show a overview of all the
    states, but frankly, this is something we consider to be way too complex
    for what it's worth. The single-state view is both simple and effective,
    especially since a state is the logical unit of work in a FSM design.
    An overall design is as useful as a full printout of a long program.
    I.e. it can be impressive but does not say very much.

    As regards Ada support: a competent Ada programmer can make this in less
    than a day, by adapting one of the existing schemas. I forget whether
    Ada supports constructs like the C #include statement, and
    statically-assigned arrays, but presumably it does. You can probably start
    from the C or C++ schemas. In general it's a matter of hand-translating the
    schema code, then generating code and seeing that it compiles. Use a simple
    test case such as the expression evaluator that comes with Libero.

    When you've developed an Ada schema, you'll be able to tailor it for
    various versions of Ada, either with separate schemas, or by using
    conditional options in a single schema, as we do for Cobol. In any case,
    we'll be glad to assist in this work, and to include any eventual Ada
    schema in the standard Libero distribution.

    Subject:            Drumbeat 2.0
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Will Xitami work with Drumbeat 2.0 from Elemental Software?
    I must say that Xitami is my server of choice, however there is a growing
    need to build database-driven websites (as they are no doubt the real sites
    of tomorrow), and since I am NOT a programmer, the newer programs such as
    Cold Fusion and Drumbeat are at least one answer to my web development
    needs. Drumbeat (probably owned by Microsoft), as you probably know, is set
    up to work easily with Access and ODBC.
    Since I have never been enamored with either MS Personal Web Server or
    Information Server, I am hoping that there is compatibility with Xitami.
    Best Regards,
    Brett Hardcastle

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    Indeed, database-driven websites (or, put another way, web-based
    business applications) are indeed an important part of the future.  We
    are looking at a number of ways to access simple ODBC databases from
    within Xitami; for serious work, we also make a web-based development
    tool, iMatix Studio.  See http://www.imatix.com/pub/info/twp9801.zip.

    Subject:            OS/2 versions of SFL and SMT?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I am about to make use of Libero in at least one application
    (it looks very good -- I'm surprised it doesn't get more
    mention in the newsgroups.)
    Since the first application is multi-threaded, I *might* have
    considered using SMT, except that OS/2 was not mentioned as
    a platform to which it was ported. Now, I'm not asking that
    you consider doing this (Libero seems to be sufficient), but
    I am curious: you have Xitami ported to OS/2, and, as I
    understand it, Xitami uses SFL and SMT. Does some OS/2 version
    in fact exist?
    Finally, what kind of thinking are you doing about making
    a Java version of Libero? I suppose at this time it might
    be more an intellectual curiousity than an actual tool, but
    in time -- when Java moves into mission critical areas -- it
    could find its stride. The well-known advantage, of course,
    is that you wouldn't/shouldn't need a separate version for
    each operating system.
    Good work!
    Jonathan Story

    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    There is a Java version of Libero, SMT runs just fine on OS/2, and
    Xitami does too. And yes, it's a shame that Libero does not get as much
    coverage as it deserves.
