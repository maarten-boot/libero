    Some time ago I wrote a little program who's only purpose was to
    calculate its own remaining useful life-span.  I ran it today.  It
    still works.  This is what it said:

        Fri, 1998-May-31 22:20:17
        580 days before 2000 A.D.
        82 weeks
        390 business days
        359 working days

    Twenty-four Liberettos of varying quality and size have come and gone
    since we raised the issue of the Millenium Bug in Liberetto I/6.  We've
    seen the last two years develop much as predicted: amusement, denial,
    apathy, shock, and now the onset of panic.

    In many countries it is starting to be difficult to recruit new software
    developers.  Companies are taking young developers from universities and
    colleges as fast as they can graduate, and sucking older developers back
    out of retirement.  Every week or so I get an e-mail from someone asking
    if I don't happen to know a couple of available developers.  I don't, so
    you guys can stop asking.

    Every computer consulting company I know is booked solid for the next
    couple of years as a tidal wave of work hits.  Rather than the steady
    rate of change we're used to (with large systems being replaced or
    overhauled every 5-10 years), we're seeing a peak as companies decide to
    replace their old systems now rather than wait another three or four
    years and risk catastrophe.  Smiles all round in the consulting companies,
    until the personnel manager reports that 'no, we did not manage to fill
    those positions'.
    
    The irony is that to compensate for the last two wasted years, projects
    need to be shortened, and that means employing more people (a fallacious
    proposition in itself, but that's another discussion).

    If you still think this will not affect you, think again.  We're seeing
    the start of a period of chaos that will last until at least mid-2000,
    with secondary effects lasting for several years longer.  Let me get
    out my crystal ball...

      - Anything in this sector that is not critical to the year 2000
        deadline will find itself progressively starved of people and money.
        
      - The rapid rate of change that we've come to depend on will halt for
        at least a couple of years.  Yes, even C++ experts will work in
        Cobol if the pay is good enough.
        
      - Many of the large projects now being started will never complete.
        For the companies involved (on both sides of the contract), this is
        a potentially fatal situation.

    I'll just mention the storm clouds that are building over our global
    economy, with the triple jeopardy of an over-inflated US stock market,
    the European Union's monetary adventurism, and the beckoning collapse of
    Japan.  Okay, I mentioned this.  Now add a little popular Millenium
    Fever, some serious doubts about the computer infrastructure of a number
    of prominent corporations (about this time in 1999), and what d'ya have?

    Let's assume for the sake of sanity that the stock markets do not crash,
    that people keep their faith in the economy, and that we can spend our
    way out of whatever minor crisis happens by.  One thing is certain, and
    that's that the post-2000 era will see a glut of software developers
    (depending on how many get burnt in the town square, of course).  Oh yes,
    that army of undertrained kids, survivors of a desperate war against the
    clock.  They all want your job.  Ho-ho.

    iMatix Corporation pushes for 'One On Every Desktop'
        In a packed news conference today, iMatix explained their plans to
        get the Xitami web server running on every desktop.  "Today's PCs
        have more than enough grunt to run Xitami and not notice," said
        iMatix spokesperson Mandy.  Rumour has it that iMatix will release
        a 'Universal Web Server' CD-ROM which will include Xitami versions
        for most operating systems on the planet.

    iMatix Wins OpenSource Certification!!
        OpenSource is Eric S. Raymond's excellent initiative to promote the
        principles of making software source code available as part of the
        business model.  Of course, iMatix is a pioneer in this field, and
        we'll be proud to show the forthcoming OpenSource logo on our home
        page.  See http://www.opensource.org for more details.

    Xitami hits 3rd place in Web Servers Top 10!!
        Check-out http://serverwatch.internet.com/top10.html for the current
        Web Server Top 10...  Yes, our little Xitami server is still going
        strong in third place.

    The LRWP Persistent CGI Protocol...

    From:             "J. Scott McKellar"  <mck9@swbell.net>
    Subject:          Re: Liberetto III/5 -- LWRP
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Your article on LRWP piqued my interest.  I don't foresee any use
    for it myself, but others in my company may.
    Unfortunately Liberetto didn't include any pointers to more detailed
    information.  Is there a URL somewhere for information about LRWP,
    or do we have to download Xitami?  
    I'm wondering about security.  If an LRWP asks to take over a set of
    URLs, does the server (e.g. Xitami) comply mindlessly, or does it use
    discretion?  For example, does it consult a list of trusted LWRPs?
    Without some such precaution, a rogue LRWP could hijack URLs
    illegitimately.
    Up to now, Xitami has presumably been of particular interest to homebrew
    sites operating on a shoestring.  After all, it's free.  These users
    can mostly tolerate security holes and occasionally erratic
    distributions.
    LRWP is more relevant to professionally run commercial sites, and to
    in-house applications within large companies.  These customers will be
    more concerned about security, stability, and robustness -- and more
    willing to pay for support contracts.  I hope LRWP gives you an entree
    into this more lucrative market.

    From:             Eric Chisholm <tceeng@sprynet.com>
    Subject:          Kudos for Xitami
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
    Congratulations on an excellent product that works !
    The LRWP capability is great.  It has allowed me to quickly
    create a system that allows control via a serial port of
    custom hardware.

    Liberetto's Editorial on Microsoft...
    
    From:             "Richard Storey" <ncfrs@msn.com>
    Subject:          Re: Liberetto III/5
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
    A flawless analysis and aptly put.  I would append it with the facts
    of IBM's rise to domination being primarily due to government's desire
    to have a strong contractor to rely upon for computing technology
    (during the 50's) and therefore, by government contracts, IBM rose to
    extra-ordinary market presence.  Further, regarding MS, software
    developers and retailers of PCs are very much responsible for MS's
    success and domination due to their desire for a standard to lessen
    development costs and a market place that is less complex to compete in.
    Nature hates a monopoly.  MS's dominance will come down one way or
    another.

    From:             John Levy <John.Levy@qntm.com>
    Subject:          RE: Liberetto III/5
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    
    Bravo, Pieter.  Perhaps the proper strategy in dealing with Microsoft is
    to encourage them to take on more and more markets, leading (sooner) to
    their demise by excessive executive & bureaucratic overhead (Bill can't
    follow 59 markets simultaneously).  I remember the '60s when we proposed
    to send the Red Chinese astray by air-dropping the circuit diagrams of
    the IBM System/360 on them...

    Data Sleuthing, or "How many beers did I miss?"

    One of the national sports for tourists in Belgium is to try to drink at
    least one of each brand of beer produced in the country.  The difficulty
    with this sport is that it's hard to get a notion of progress, due to
    the large and generally quantum nature of the beer market.  For instance,
    there are some brands so rare that it is impossible to both observe and
    drink the beer at the same time.  There are also, in Belgium, some
    brands so strong that it is difficult to drink and do anything at all
    afterwards.

    It's a little-known fact, but the number of beers still waiting to be
    drunk can actually be estimated.  Let's say that the new pub you are
    visiting boasts 200 brands of bottled beer.  Now, you've 100 different
    brands on in your little black book (a vital accessory for the serious
    participant, almost as important as the small jar of Dijon mustard).
    By comparing your list with the pub's menu, you see that half of the
    beers you've tried are provided in this pub.  This tells you that
    statistically, you've tried about 25% of all known beers.  So, there
    are perhaps 400 beers in total, and thus 300 more to try.

    Of course, the answer gets better the more pubs you visit.

    We can apply this important lesson to more sober subjects.  When we at
    iMatix World HQ are producing a public release of a product, X, we like
    to be able to make a continuous estimate how many bugs there are in it.
    This is useful to know, since the technical support effort depends largely
    on this.

    Let's say that during the first month of testing a product, we found B
    bugs ourselves.  Our helpful beta tester users found R bugs, of which S
    were among those we also found.  The number of remaining unknown bugs,
    U can be estimated as:

        U = ((R / S) x B) - B - (R - S)

    which can be simplified to

        U = (R / S - 1) x B + S - R.

    So there.  Now you may have that beer.


 == RANTS AND RAVES --..-..----...-..---.-.-.-.-----....-.-..-..-.---...-..---

    Yes, introducing a new section where we let you take the soap-box, walk
    the plank, burn your bridges and get flame mail from the other side of
    the world...  This month, Rob Judd explains his opinions about the GNU
    General Public License, which iMatix uses for its Libero product.
    
    "The main objections I have [to the GNU General Public License] are:

    1) In order to distribute any version of GNU software which has been
       made useful for another system by correct porting (and let's face it,
       these tools *require* that you think as though you're programming in
       a Unix environment), one then has include the whole original
       distribution complete with a morass of confusing and irrelevant
       documentation. This is what some call the "licence virus" effect.

    2) The FSF "manifesto" reads like something from fifties Russia.

    3) There are better ways to distribute free software if that's what you
       want to do, as you have discovered.

    I have nothing against software being free, far from it.  However, if I
    spend three months debugging and reworking a half-baked and unsupported
    piece of code - including finishing the port properly - to the point
    where it hardly resembles the original work either in function or
    usefulness, then I feel it fairly unreasonable that I am *required* to
    make my version free and distribute the junk with it. This only cripples
    my version, aligns me with dodgy philosophies which I'd rather not
    associated with, and reduces the likelihood that the new version will
    see daylight. If that's the way to make better free software available,
    I'm a jackass."
